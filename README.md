# Algo Trading Python Package

The Algo Trading Python package is a comprehensive library that offers data wrangling, backtesting, and live trading capabilities for developing and testing trading strategies.

## Data Wrangling Package Library
Data wrangling is a crucial part of the data analysis process. It involves four main stages:

1. Data Ingestion: Gather raw data from various sources, such as databases, files, APIs, or web scraping.

2. Data Cleaning: Clean and transform the data to address issues like missing values, duplicates, outliers, and errors.

3. Data Transformation: Prepare the data for analysis by performing tasks like feature engineering, scaling variables, and encoding categorical variables.

4. Data Integration: Combine and merge multiple datasets to create a unified and consistent dataset for analysis.

The data wrangling process is iterative, allowing you to refine the data as you gain new insights or encounter issues during analysis.

## Backtesting Capabilities
The Algo Trading package also includes powerful backtesting capabilities. Backtesting allows you to test your trading strategies using historical data to evaluate their performance and make informed decisions.

## Project Origin
The original codebase for this package was built on forked code from 'https://www.codearmo.com/python-tutorial/algo-trading-intro'. However, the package has since evolved and expanded to include additional features and functionalities.

Please note that while Codearmo provided the initial codebase, they take no responsibility or liability for how this code is used.
